7th Sword




Wthat is the "feel" this game wants to capture?

Inspirations:

- WoW -> grind, world design
- Hearthstone -> texture design
- clash royale -> UI
- ninja slash -> UI

- 

How should the gameplay loop be? How to incorporate the story?

possibilities:

- map -> choose your destination and fulfill a quest
- continuous scene after scene -> random
- chapter selection
- just story mode -> go


UI design:

    - List ?, Map ?, Button ?
    - Quest hub design
        - show quest list
        - show quest giver
        - show text
        - show GO button
